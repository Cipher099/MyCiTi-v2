# MyCiTi-v2

I built the first version of the MyCiti App using data which I scraped from the MyCiti website (because they wouldn;t give it to me). It was my first app and what I used to learn the new iOS langiage - Swift.

Since then, I rebuilt the app literally from the ground up. This time I used the API service from WhereIsMyTransport to gather the necessary transport data.


This project is open to the community and whoever wants to contribute to it.

Make a change, submit a PR and let's do what the City Of Cape Town can't :P
